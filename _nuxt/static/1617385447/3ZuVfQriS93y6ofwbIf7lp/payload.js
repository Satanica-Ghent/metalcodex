Yeah!\n\nSo you children of the world, listen to what I say\nIf you want a better place to live in, spread the word today\nShow the world that love is still alive, you must be brave\nOr you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!\n\nChildren of the grave\nChildren of the grave",bookmarked:b}},mutations:void 0}}("3ZuVfQriS93y6ofwbIf7lp",false)));
