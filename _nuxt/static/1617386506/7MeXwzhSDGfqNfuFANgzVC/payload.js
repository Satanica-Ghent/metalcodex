How do you own disorder, disorder?\nNow, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep\nSomewhere between the sacred silence and sleep\nDisorder, disorder, disorder\n\nMore wood for their fires, loud neighbors\nFlashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck\nEating seeds as a pastime activity\nThe toxicity of our city, of our city\n\nYou, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?\nNow, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep\nSomewhere between the sacred silence and sleep\nDisorder, disorder, disorder\n\nYou, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?\nNow, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep\nSomewhere between the sacred silence and sleep\nDisorder, disorder, disorder\n\nWhen I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts\nWhen I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts",bookmarked:c}},mutations:void 0}}("7MeXwzhSDGfqNfuFANgzVC","Toxicity",false)));
