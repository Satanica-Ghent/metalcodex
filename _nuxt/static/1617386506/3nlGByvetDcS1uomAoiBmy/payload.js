Can I believe that what I saw\nThat night was real and not just fantasy?\nJust what I saw, in my old dreams, were they\nReflections of my warped mind staring back at me?\nCause in my dreams, it's always there\nThe evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair\n\nYEAH!\n\nThe night was black, was no use holding back\nCause I just had to see, was someone watching me?\nIn the mist, dark figures move and twist\nWas all this for real or just some kind of hell?\n\n666 the number of the beast\nHell and fire was spawned to be released\n\nTorches blazed and sacred chants were phrased\nAs they start to cry, hands held to the sky\nIn the night, the fires are burning bright\nThe ritual has begun, Satan's work is done\n\n666 the number of the beast\nSacrifice is going on tonight\n\nThis can't go on, I must inform the law\nCan this still be real, or just some crazy dream?\nBut I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes\nThey seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes\n\n666 the number of the beast\n666 the one for you and me\n\nI'm coming back, I will return\nAnd I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn\nI have the fire, I have the force\nI have the power to make my evil take its course",bookmarked:b}},mutations:void 0}}("3nlGByvetDcS1uomAoiBmy",false)));
